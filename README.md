# NBA

Just a small depot for NBA code and stats. Mostly using R.

hboxandcustomstats: includes my NBA metric built from box-score stats. Not a statistical plus/minus; it uses past seasons to estimate player value. Also includes a variety of custom stats, like BLK/(PF+1)
Dredge: includes my NBA metric built from all the available stats in the box-score and the play-by-play logs.
turnoverestimates: team turnovers are available from 1974 to 1977, but not individual turnovers. This makes it tougher to apply NBA metrics to this period of time. Thus, I estimated turnovers using a method that utilizes turnover rates in the following years and adjusting the estimates to fit a team's real turnover total.
